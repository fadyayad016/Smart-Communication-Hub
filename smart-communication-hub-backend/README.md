 AI Integration: The "Smart Communication Hub"

This section details the "AI-powered insights panel," a core feature of the mission.

Where AI is Used

The AI feature is located in the "AI Conversation Insights" panel on the right side of the chat dashboard.

Why AI is Used

The purpose of this panel is to provide users with immediate, high-level understanding of their conversations without having to read the entire message history. This adds significant business value by:

Saving Time: A "Summary" allows a user (e.g., a manager or colleague) to quickly catch up on the context of a conversation.

Providing Context: A "Sentiment" analysis (e.g., "Slightly Positive," "Neutral") helps users gauge the tone and outcome of the discussion.

Identifying Key Topics: (Future enhancement) The AI could also extract key tags or topics (like "Project Deadlines," "Resource Allocation") to make conversations searchable by theme.

Current Implementation (Mock Data)

For this project demo, the AI insights are mocked. The backend does not make a live call to an AI service like OpenAI.

Instead, the InsightsController (or a similar service) generates and returns a static JSON object containing a pre-written summary and sentiment. This was done to:

Focus on Architecture: Demonstrate the complete frontend and backend architecture, including how the data would flow from the API to the React UI.

Ensure App Stability: Avoid reliance on external API keys or network latency during the demo.

Simulate the Feature: Show exactly how the feature would look and feel to the end-user.

In a production environment, the POST /insights/generate endpoint would be triggered, sending the full conversation text to the OpenAI (or similar) API and then saving the response in our Insights database table.
